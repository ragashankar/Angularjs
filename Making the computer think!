Using console.log
You may have noticed that the interpreter doesn't print out every single thing it does. So if we want to know what it's thinking, we sometimes have to ask it to speak to us.

console.log() will take whatever is inside the parentheses and log it to the console below your codeâ€”that's why it's called console.log()!

This is commonly called printing out

console.log(2*5) // Prints 10
console.log("Hello") // Prints Hello

Comparison :
// Here is an example of using the greater than (>) operator.
console.log(15 > 4); // 15 > 4 evaluates to true, so true is printed.

// Fill in with >, <, === so that the following print out true:
console.log("Xiao Hui".length < 122); prints true
console.log("Goody Donaldson".length >= 8); prints true
console.log(8*2 === 16); prints true

Condtition:

if ( "Raghavendran Shankar".length > 7 ) {
    console.log("You have a long name" );
}

if else:

if ( "Raghavendran Shankar".length <= 7) 
{
    console.log("Let's go down the first road!");
}
else 
{
     console.log("Your name is way too large");
    
}
